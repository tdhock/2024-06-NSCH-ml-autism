Hi, Here is a folder with the combined 2016-2022 NSCH data file along
with codebooks for each year. All the 95 values mean that the person
was not asked the question (was ineligible/skipped). I recoded the 99
values, which are true missing (person did not answer) to a "." value.

I'm interested in how ML might be used with the autism_16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22 variables as an output (2 and 3 values indicate the child
ever had or currently has autism), asdage_16,17,18,19,20,21,222 as an
output including dichotomizing to be < 3 (early dx) versus 3 or older,
and asdbehtreat_16,17,18,19,20,21,22 (yes) as an output. Perhaps we
can discuss more in June! Olivia
